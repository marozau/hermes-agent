## Document Overview

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for {{project_name}}. It serves as the source of truth for what will be built and provides traceability from requirements through implementation.

## Functional Requirements

Functional Requirements (FRs) define **what** the system does - specific features and behaviors.

Each requirement includes:
- **ID**: Unique identifier (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)
- **Priority**: Must Have / Should Have / Could Have / Won't Have (MoSCoW)
- **Description**: What the system should do
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How to verify it's complete

## Non-Functional Requirements

Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) define **how** the system performs - quality attributes and constraints.

---

## Epics

Epics are logical groupings of related functionality that will be broken down into user stories during sprint planning (Phase 4).

Each epic maps to multiple functional requirements and will generate 2-10 stories.

## User Stories (High-Level)

User stories follow the format: "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]."

These are preliminary stories. Detailed stories will be created in Phase 4 (Implementation).

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Architecture

Run `/architecture` to create system architecture based on these requirements.

The architecture will address:
- All functional requirements (FRs)
- All non-functional requirements (NFRs)
- Technical stack decisions
- Data models and APIs
- System components

### Phase 4: Sprint Planning

After architecture is complete, run `/sprint-planning` to:
- Break epics into detailed user stories
- Estimate story complexity
- Plan sprint iterations
- Begin implementation
